# 🧠 Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

Forecasting the potential future revenue a business can expect from its customers is critical for data-driven strategies. This project presents a full pipeline using Python, from data preprocessing to clustering and modeling, to help businesses understand and forecast Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).
